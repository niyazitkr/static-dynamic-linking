You can find Static and Dynamic Linking Examples

Two types of linking : STATIC and DYNAMIC(shared)

Static Library

Windows -> .lib (Library)
Linux -> .a (Archive)


Dynamic Library
Windows -> .dll (Dynamic link linking)
Linux -> .so (shared object)

In static library example just you can use Makefile.
If you are using Makefile with an dynamic library, you should look Makefile comment section before make run command.
